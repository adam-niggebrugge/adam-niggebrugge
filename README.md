- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular syntax/conventions
- :sweat_drops: I proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL.
- I am becoming familiar GraphQL. Other NodeJS libraries I have used are Express, Apollo-client/server, Handlebars, Mongoose.
- I have learned about RESTful architecture
- I have used Bootstrap and Materialize, and really like Materialize with 🔄 plans to alter some existing coding activites using such. READMEs for those projects should show 🚧 
- 👀 I’m interested in relational databases (conceptionally easier for me) and gaining more SQL experience. Also curious about graph dbs that MongoDB offers.
- I have been working on a project at Siemens that involves recoding legacy software tools. We have been use an Agile methodology and MS Planner Boards for tracking the project progress.
