## Personal 👨‍🔬
- 👋 Hi, I’m @adam-niggebrugge, I currently work within the Siemens LDA structure. In the beginning this was not an IT role, but is slowly morphing into one.

### Tech Used 💻
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
- I am becoming familiar with install the many libraries through NodeJS.
- I am still learning the ins and outs of RESTful interactions
- I have used Bootstrap and Materialize, and really like Materialize with 🔄 plans to alter some existing coding activites using such. READMEs for those projects should show 🚧 
- 👀 I’m interested in relational databases (conceptionally easier for me) and gaining more SQL experience. Also curious about graph dbs that MongoDB offers.
- I have been working on a project at Siemens that involves recoding legacy software tools. We have been use an Agile methodology and MS Planner Boards for tracking the project progress.

### Collaboration 📓
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (when I have more time) developing logic for an app
