## Personal 👨‍🔬
- 👋 Hi, I’m @adam-niggebrugge, I work within the Siemens LDA structure. 
_ _ _ _

- I have had exposure to coding concepts through 🏫 secondary and tertinary education  institutions ([LCHS](https://www.lexingtoncatholic.com/) and [UKY](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research-faculty/departments/computer-science)). Now I am pursuing an online instructor lead coding bootcamp (HOOO-RAH, wait no I was in the Navy) which covers Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Nodejs and OOP. 
- On the very personal, I am becoming a first time parent (as is true for the wife), 👶's proposed due date of Sept 14 🤞.

### Tech Used 💻
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and general API development
- Have used Bootstrap and Materialize, and really like Materialize with 🔄 plans to alter some existing coding activites using such. READMEs for those projects should show 🚧 
- 👀 I’m interested in relational databases (conceptionally easier for me) and gaining more SQL experience. Also curious about graph dbs like Mongo work.
- I have been working on a project at Siemens that involves recoding legacy software tools. We have been use an Agile methodology and MS Planner Boards for tracking the project progress.

### Collaboration 📓
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (when I have more time) developing logic for an app
